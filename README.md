## About

We were all slacking off in the living room the other night when my landlord started playing [连连看 on 4399.com](http://www.4399.com/flash/17801_4.htm). It soon turned into a heated competition between Ms.Landlord vs. tenants team, but she was so good at 连连看 that none of use could beat her.

And then I thought, hey this game shouldn't be that hard to write, and it'd be really fun if we could customize the game with pictures that are more relatable.
